Then lockdown 1.0 happened and it was on offer, so I tried it out.</p>\n<p>Essentially, Dark Souls is an extremely difficult computer game that has you doing the same fighty-fighty stuff over and over until you master it and can move on. You play as some sort of fighting/thieving/magic person and you have to battle loads of monsters in a world ravaged by something. Oh, and you lose stuff every time you die. Oh, and everybody is either crazy or miserable. But sure, <a href=\"https://kotaku.com/what-dark-souls-is-really-all-about-5874599\">there are better explanations out there</a>, if you're interested.</p>\n<p>Honestly though, the lore and setting are quite cool but I'm terrible at remembering those sort of details! And I was <em>really</em> into into it, <strong>for a while</strong> at least.</p>\n<blockquote>\n  <p>Ahh you think you're different? That you can handle it? Yes, I remember that feeling. For I was the same.</p>\n  <cite>Crestfallen Merchant, Dark Souls</cite>\n</blockquote>\n<h2>So... Web development?</h2>\n<p>Obviously, this is <strong>exactly like modern front-end web development</strong>.</p>\n<p>Well maybe not at first glance, but if you are involved in the web world in any form, I'm sure you are aware of how fast things move. There is always something new to learn, or some <del>hot new</del> <ins>better way</ins> of doing things. Mastered a framework? Unfortunately, that framework is now obsolete/non-maintained/gone up a major version/uncool and you should be doing it <em>this way</em> instead. This loop felt like <em>levelling up</em>, even if only when reflecting back on how far you might have come.</p>\n<p>It's non-stop and, at times, overwhelming. But that's what makes it interesting, and often exciting! For a long time I've been able to keep up, and I believed it was my responsibility as a web developer to keep an eye on things, learn x and use y. And for a long time, it was enjoyable!</p>\n<p>But this is where, for me, it starts to become a &quot;Souls&quot; game... The fun goes. After seeing the 1000th article about why I should be learning React with Typescript and GraphQL I pretty much checked out. Sounds suspiciously like a thing called ‚Äúburnout‚Äù, but it didn't <em>feel</em> like what I'd read about burnout. I still liked web development ‚Äì it's just that JavaScript things lost their appeal. For those in the know, this was my ‚Äú<a href=\"https://darksouls.wiki.fextralife.com/Seath+The+Scaleless\">Seath the Scaleless</a>‚Äù moment in Dark Souls land (the second time, not the first time!).</p>\n<h2>Moving on</h2>\n<p>Anecdotally, most people that start Dark Souls don't finish it. It doesn't mean it wasn't worth the ride. As there are many beautiful and deep moments in Dark Souls, running the web dev race has been good fun and I've learned a lot.</p>\n<p>This comparison that ends in me quitting Dark Souls doesn't mean I have decided to get out of the web game (so to speak). I now appreciate what I <em>can focus on</em> and what I <strong>do care about</strong> in this industry. There is still plenty of levelling up to be done, but my viewpoint has shifted. Mastering the craft doesn't mean playing with every new tool that comes out. It doesn't mean being at the cutting edge of things. It's about being liberated from the rat-race of being a ‚ÄúReact dev‚Äù or a ‚ÄúSvelte dev‚Äù or a ‚ÄúVue dev‚Äù or a ‚ÄúTailwind evangelist‚Äù. It's about fundamentals.</p>\n<p>Learning JavaScript best practices; is JavaScript even needed?; what are the accessibility implications?; is performance going to be affected?; am I using the appropriate HTML elements?; What is the most efficient way of doing this with CSS? What about no JavaScript users and older browsers?</p>\n<p>These are the questions that I find more interesting these days. Even if I don't make it to <del>the end of the game</del> <ins>senior developer level</ins>, asking these types of questions will allow me to be the best developer I can be. I genuinely believe that this approach can make any developer framework-agnostic. This may or may not sound obvious, but if you are neck-deep in front-end newsletters and blogs then it can be easy to forget.</p>\n<p>To be fair, I think this realisation has come with both the benefit of experience and a global pandemic. Life is too short to be forcing yourself to spend evenings learning things that you are told you <strong>need to learn right now</strong>, when, in the real world, you really don't.</p>\n<p>Aaaand I think that is as far as I can take this comparison. It seemed like a good idea at the time üôÇ</p>\n<blockquote>\n  <p>\n    What‚Äôs wrong? Get a bit of a scare out there? No problem. Have a seat and get comfortable. We‚Äôll both be hollow before you know it.\n  </p>\n  <cite>Crestfallen Warrior, Dark Souls</cite>\n</blockquote>","content_text":null,"date_published":"Wed, 17 Feb 2021 21:05:01 +0000","tags":["posts"]},{"id":"https://bl-rd.github.io/bl-rd-archive//posts/things/rock-paper-rusty-scissors/","url":"https://bl-rd.github.io/bl-rd-archive//posts/things/rock-paper-rusty-scissors/","title":"Rock, Paper, (Rusty) Scissors","content_html":"<p>A game of Rock, Paper, Scissors, built with Rust and wasm-bindgen</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://github.com/bl-rd/rock-paper-rusty-scissors\">Play the game</a></p>\n","content_text":null,"date_published":"Sat, 30 May 2020 17:02:44 +0000","tags":["things"]},{"id":"https://bl-rd.github.io/bl-rd-archive//posts/video-game-style-text/","url":"https://bl-rd.github.io/bl-rd-archive//posts/video-game-style-text/","title":"Video-game style text","content_html":"<h2>But why?</h2>\n<p>Because <em>it's my website</em> and <strong>I wanted to</strong>!</p>\n<p>I've been playing a few pixel art games over the last year or so (for example <a href=\"https://yachtclubgames.com/shovel-knight/\">Shovel Knight</a>, <a href=\"http://www.celestegame.com/\">Celeste</a>) and liked how adding movement to text could add extra meaning.</p>\n<p>As moving of the letters is used for extra emphasis, or to imply some significance, I liked the idea of adding some movement to the <code>&lt;em&gt;</code> and <code>&lt;strong&gt;</code> tags to add further meaning to their semantics.</p>\n<p>I've chosen to use the <a href=\"https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Web_Animations_API\">Web Animations API</a> (instead of CSS animations) as I can have more control over each animated element without having to rely on a CSS pre-processor.</p>\n<h2>Targeting individual letters</h2>\n<p>To animate each letter, I need a way of targeting them each in turn.

I think it does add some extra (appropriate) emphasis, as well as a bit of character but I appreciate it might not be to everyone's taste.</p>\n<p>I liked learning about the Web Animations API and <strong>love</strong> that there is a library free way of doing this type of animation. I'm sure there are certainly plenty of creative possibilities to be had in the future, especially when <a href=\"https://caniuse.com/#feat=web-animation\">the full implementation of the API appears in browsers</a>.</p>\n<p>As it stands I like it and, as I said before, <em>it's my website</em>!</p>\n","content_text":null,"date_published":"Sun, 16 Feb 2020 16:55:38 +0000","tags":["posts"]},{"id":"https://bl-rd.github.io/bl-rd-archive//posts/hello-world/","url":"https://bl-rd.github.io/bl-rd-archive//posts/hello-world/","title":"Hello, world!","content_html":"<h2>Why</h2>\n<p>Initially, it was <a href=\"https://www.jvt.me/posts/2019/07/22/why-website/\">this blog article</a> by Jamie Tanna that resonated with me and got me thinking about creating my own site. As well as being a <em>good citizen of the web</em>, I have three main motivations:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>refining/improving my front-end skills;</li>\n<li>the <a href=\"https://indieweb.org/\">indieweb movement</a>;</li>\n<li>keeping a track of what I've been up to</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Also, personal sites are <a href=\"https://personalsit.es/\">all the rage these days</a>!</p>\n<h2>Sharpen the saw</h2>\n<p>My plan for 2020 is to focus on becoming a <strong>specialist</strong> front-end developer - and there are a lot of new features and APIs being shipped these days. Having a personal site will hopefully push me to try some of these shiny new things. At the time of writing, this site (progressively!) uses <a href=\"https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Web_Components\">native web components</a> and the <a href=\"https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Web_Animations_API\">web animations API</a>.</p>\n<h2>Indieweb</h2>\n<p>The <a href=\"https://indieweb.org/\">indieweb</a> sounds pretty cool, and ticks a lot of boxes for me. Even as a reasonably seasoned developer though, I find the sheer amount of concepts rather overwhelming ‚Äî thankfully sites like <a href=\"https://indiewebify.me/\">indiewebify.me</a> simplify things a bit. It'll be a continual work in progress, but as with most things on the web, a fun challenge.</p>\n<h2>Self-documentation</h2>\n<p>There is also the additional benefit of having somewhere just to dump <em>stuff</em>. For example, I am planning to keep track of my favourite albums as I discover them, and I (very) occasionally like to think I can learn to make art and I like the idea of having a decentralised place where I can store what I make and keep track of what I've done.</p>\n<p>There is also the subject of blogging, or just sharing generally. I've read so many times that is a good thing to blog about web dev stuff, but I've always been too introverted to do it. While I don't really agree with the term or the connotations, I can probably be categorised as a <a href=\"https://css-tricks.com/dark-matter-what-it-is-and-how-we-all-contribute-to-it/\">Dark-Matter Developer</a>. I've read plenty of blogs, been to conferences, looked at loads of talented people's work but never felt like I could contribute anything meaningful. Well, going forward I'm taking the approach of ‚Äú<a href=\"https://www.sarasoueidan.com/desk/just-write/\">Just Write</a>‚Äù and see what happens. At the very least it will serve as a useful reminder for future me, and help me focus my thoughts in a vaguely coherent way!</p>\n<h2>Bonus points</h2>\n<p>The bottom line is that I'm hoping to enjoy it. It will be nice to revisit why I enjoy working in this industry and to experiment and challenge myself on the way. All in my safe little corner of the world wide web.</p>\n","content_text":null,"date_published":"Thu, 02 Jan 2020 14:37:33 +0000","tags":["posts"]},{"id":"https://bl-rd.github.io/bl-rd-archive//posts/things/gravity-hamster/","url":"https://bl-rd.github.io/bl-rd-archive//posts/things/gravity-hamster/","title":"Gravity Hamster","content_html":"A pen I was very surprised to find featured on Codepen's \"picked pens\" list one day.","content_text":null,"date_published":"Tue, 14 May 2019 21:25:06 +0000","tags":["things"]}],"home_page_url":"https://bl-rd.github.io/bl-rd-archive/","description":"Bletherings of Bill, a web developer based in Cumbria."}
