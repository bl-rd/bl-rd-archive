And I'm also a web developer by trade. I enjoy making performant, accessible and progressively enhanced websites.

I live ~~in~~ very near the Lake District in Cumbria, not too far away from where I grew up. Having been away to uni, travelled and lived the big(ish) city-life, myself, my wife and our two children now call the good ol' Cumbrian countryside {{<footnote-link yam>}}_&ldquo;yam&rdquo;_{{</footnote-link>}}.

## Work

Currently, I work as a full-stack developer in a small team at [Lancaster University](https://www.lancaster.ac.uk) (one of [the top 10 universities in the UK](https://www.theguardian.com/education/ng-interactive/2018/may/29/university-league-tables-2019), don't you know). We build internal apps and APIs for our students and staff, such as the [Staff Intranet](https://portal.lancaster.ac.uk/intranet/news) and [Student Portal](https://portal.lancaster.ac.uk/portal/news). Our current technology stack is Vue.js, .NET WebAPI and SQL Server.

## Not work

Doing dad-things takes up most of my non-work time. While this is awesome, I try and do other (non-code related!) things too

I'm really into climbing, having had a late start to the sport a few years ago. Of late, I've also been trying to get back into playing the guitar after an extended foray in drumming. Occasionally I kid myself into thinking that I can still skateboard (I can't), and find myself really relating to [this song](https://pkewx3.bandcamp.com/track/mid-20s-skateboarder-4 "Mid-20s Skateboarder") by Pkew Pkew Pkew (early&ndash;thirties and mid&ndash;twenties are practically the same thing, aren't they?).

You can get a better idea of what I'm up to _right now_ on [my now page](/now).

    &ldquo;Yam&rdquo; is the traditional Cumbrian term for &ldquo;home&rdquo;. In fact, one of my favourite sayings is <i>&ldquo;'As gaan yam&rdquo;</i> (I'm going home).
