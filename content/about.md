And I'm also a web developer by trade. I enjoy making performant, accessible and progressively enhanced webites, some of which you can find on my [projects page](/projects).

I live ~~in~~ very near the Lake District in Cumbria, not too far away from where I grew up. Having been away to uni, travelled and lived the big(ish) city-life, myself, my wife and our two children now call the good ol' Cumbrian countryside _{{<footnote-link yam>}}yam{{</footnote-link>}}_.

## Work

Currently, I work as a full-stack developer in a small team at {{<external-link href="https://www.lancaster.ac.uk">}}Lancaster University{{</external-link>}} (one of {{<external-link href="https://www.theguardian.com/education/ng-interactive/2018/may/29/university-league-tables-2019">}}the top 10 universities in the UK{{</external-link>}}, don't you know).

Feel free to take a look at my CV, or if you prefer you can find me on LinkedIn.

## Not work

Doing dad-things takes up most of my non-work time. While this is awesome, I try and do other, non-code related, things too!

I'm really into climbing, having had a late-start to the sport a few years ago. Of late, I've also been trying to get back into playing guitar after an extended foray in drumming. Occasionally I kid myself into thinking that I can still skateboard (I can't), and find myself really relating to {{<external-link href="https://pkewx3.bandcamp.com/track/mid-20s-skateboarder-4" title="Mid-20's Skateboarder by Pkew Pkew Pkew">}}this song{{</external-link>}} by Pkew Pkew Pkew (early&ndash;thirties and min&ndash;twenties are practically the same thing, aren't they?).

You can get a better idea of what I'm up to _right now_ on [my now page](/now).

    &ldquo;Yam&rdquo; is the traditional Cumbrian term for &ldquo;home&rdquo;. In fact, one of my favourite sayings is <i>&ldquo;'As gaan yam&rdquo;</i> (I'm going home).
