That's about it.

## Netlify

This website is hosted on {{<external-link href="https://www.netlify.com/">}}Netlify{{</external-link>}} who offer {{<external-link href="https://www.netlify.com/products/analytics/">}}an analytics package{{</external-link>}} which I do not use. I am only just getting started with Netlify and will update this page when I have more information but I assume this means they are logging the IP address of people who come to this site (as I assume most hosting services do). Just so you know, I have no idea if I am even able to access this information and have no intention of ever doing so.

## Browser

On a slight aside, I'm going to encourage you to use the {{<external-link href="">}}Firefox web browser{{</external-link>}} (if you don't already). They have enhanced tracking protection built-in, so you don't have to worry about tracking scripts etc. You also don't have to worry about installing a script-blocking extension from a company with {{<external-link href="https://www.wired.com/2016/03/heres-how-that-adblocker-youre-using-makes-money/">}}questionable privacy ethics{{</external-link>}}.

I've been a long time fan of the browser and have been using it as my development browser for years. Additionally, I love the new design that the designers at Mozilla are rolling out. Seriously, in a world-wide-web that is {{<external-link href="https://css-tricks.com/browser-diversity-commentary-regarding-the-edge-news/">}}becoming increasingly Chromium-powered{{</external-link>}}, I can't recommend Firefox enough.
