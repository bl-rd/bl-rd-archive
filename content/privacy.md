That's about it.

## Netlify

This website is hosted on [Netlify](https://www.netlify.com/) who offer [an analytics package](https://www.netlify.com/products/analytics/) which I do not use. I am only just getting started with Netlify and will update this page when I have more information but I assume this means they are logging the IP address of people who come to this site (as I assume most hosting services do). Just so you know, I have no idea if I am even able to access this information and have no intention of ever doing so.

## Browser

On a slight aside, I'm going to encourage you to use the [Firefox web browser](https://www.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/) (if you don't already). They have enhanced tracking protection built-in, so you don't have to worry about tracking scripts etc. You also don't have to worry about installing a script-blocking extension from a company with [questionable privacy ethics](https://www.wired.com/2016/03/heres-how-that-adblocker-youre-using-makes-money/).

I've been a long time fan of the browser and have been using it as my development browser for years. Additionally, I love the new design that the designers at Mozilla are rolling out. Seriously, in a world-wide-web that is [becoming increasingly Chromium-powered](https://css-tricks.com/browser-diversity-commentary-regarding-the-edge-news/), I can't recommend Firefox enough.

OK, preach over. Click the badge below if you'd like some more info or if I've managed to convince you!
