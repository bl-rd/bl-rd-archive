Iâ€™ve always been drawn to &ldquo;Math Rock&rdquo; (despite the Americanism of the phrase), and this is a really creative and up-lifting take on the genre. There is some really slick guitar on this album, and it sounds effortless.

The final movement (yes, I said **movement**!) of <cite>Tangerine</cite> is epic.
