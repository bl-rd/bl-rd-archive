Cool name for a band, also a pretty cool album title. <cite>My Leather, My Fur, My Nails</cite> appeared in one of my Spotify Discover Weekly feeds once and became one of my tops of that year. I finally got round to listening to the full album and I love it.

It is a great combination of quirkiness, and I love the overall sound. It’s a real shame Stepdad don’t seem to be going anymore, especially for such crappy reasons.
