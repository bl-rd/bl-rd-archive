This is a beautiful and atmospheric EP. Before I heard this I was more used to listening to Yvette Young’s band Covet, but this is a completely different kettle of fish.

I first listened to this album on headphones when I was taking my toddler for a walk to get her to go the f**k to sleep. Living in Cumbria, of course it started raining and I got soaked, but this EP gave me a life-affirming sense of warmth.

It’s funny how good music can add a whole extra layer of meaning to perfectly ordinary experiences.
