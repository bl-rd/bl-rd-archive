How have I not listened to this album before?! I remember hearing &ldquo;New Noise&rdquo; sometime in the last decade or so, but that’s it as far as Refused are concerned. I think historically it was probably because I was put off by music that was a bit too **shout-y** (and Refused are very shout-y).

I really like how it isn’t just straight up hard-edge punk. The heavy parts seem to have _more_ energy by having the different sorts of music and sounds between. The more I listen to the album as a whole, the more I like it. I can even forgive the title &ldquo;The Apollo Programme Was a Hoax&rdquo;.
