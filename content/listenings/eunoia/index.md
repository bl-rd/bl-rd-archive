I have no idea how two guitars can keep this in sync, but it is mind-blowing. And singing at the same time no less! A few of the tracks struggle to sound different from others, but thatâ€™s OK for me as I really like the general sound.

<cite>Diastole</cite> is an exception though. That is one seriously epic song.
