I actually listened to this album **before** playing the game, purely on the strength of <cite>Minitâ€™s Awakening</cite>. That track makes everything feel legendary, even making toast in the morning (true story)!

When I did finally get round to playing the game just hearing that track made me smile, and I enjoyed the game all the more for it.

The rest of the tracks are more &ldquo;video-game music soundtrack&rdquo; but have a unique sound to them, and I occasionally will listen to the whole album when working.
