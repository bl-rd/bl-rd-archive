Probably my favourite album of the year. This EP makes me feel nostalgic for all the types of things I loved growing up, while also feeling very fresh. As far as I’m concerned, Puppet and Porter Robinson are the champs of whatever sub-genre of electronic music this is.

The manga artwork for each track is also great. Probably helped that I was reading Naruto during this period as well. I could seriously listen to _I’m Here_ all day...
