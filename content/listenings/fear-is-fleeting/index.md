Probably my favourite album of the year. This EP makes me feel nostalgic for all the types of things I loved growing up, while also feeling very fresh. Without doubt one of my most listened to albums of the year.

The manga artwork for each track is also great. Probably helped that I was reading Naruto during this period as well. I could seriously listen to <cite>Iâ€™m Here</cite> all day...
