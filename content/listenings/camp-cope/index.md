I was **really** into Camp Cope for a while. I even pre-ordered their second album [How to Socialize & Make Friends](https://campcope.bandcamp.com/album/how-to-socialise-make-friends-3) but for me this is the superior album. It’s very angsty, and sad, and angry, but in a genuine way.

This album also contains some of the most effective bass lines in any album. Seriously, they’re not complicated but they add **loads** to the songs.

<cite>Lost</cite> comes a very close second for my favourite track.
