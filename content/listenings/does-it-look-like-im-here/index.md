Started listening to this album purely from hearing one song on the a Focus Beats mix on [BBC Sounds](https://www.bbc.co.uk/sounds). It’s a really immersive electronic album, and I find it is great to listen while trying to do some work.

I have a small suspicion that it is quite a pretentious album, but I am quite far down the rabbit hole and I don’t care...
