<cite>Yeoman</cite> was apparently one of my top listened tracks on Spotify in 2017, but I actually felt the need to buy the CD (the CD!) of the album in 2019. I listen to this in my car **a lot**. The music is unique and beautifully layered, and I love that the lyrics flip from steampunk to sci-fi to fantasy. <cite>Broadback</cite> comes a very close second as my favourite track.

Highly recommended.
