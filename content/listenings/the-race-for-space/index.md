I’d been recommended this album years before, but only really listened to it this year. I guess this was partially due to all the buzz (see what I did there?) around the moon landing anniversary this month.

I was also listening to the [13 Minutes to the Moon podcast](https://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/w13xttx2) from the BBC this month which really added depth to the album, particularly <cite>Fire in the Cockpit</cite>; <cite>Other Side</cite>; and <cite>Go!</cite>.

It’s genuinely hard to choose a favourite from this album, with <cite>Sputnik</cite> and <cite>Go!</cite> coming in just short.
