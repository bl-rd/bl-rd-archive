## High-level

My main focus is trying to shift my skillset from being a full-stack developer who prefers working on the front-end to a _front-end developer_ proper&trade;. And I don't mean learning React!

What I am really wanting to hone in on is performant, accessible **design**. In other words, making stuff &mdash; starting with this website! It's pretty simple in its current form, but I've got plenty of ideas that I'd love to implement.

## What I'm doing now

I've started [a repo](https://github.com/bl-rd/stuff-made-by-me) as a bit of a dumping ground for things I'm making. It has also doubled up as a psuedo static site generator written in Rust! The generated website is viewable [here](https://bl-rd.github.io/stuff-made-by-me/).

I'm hoping to get started imminently doing [Daily UI](https://www.dailyui.co/), using this new site to host everything I make. I'm not actually going to be making a single-thing every day, but I hope that eventually I'll make it through all ðŸ’¯.

In between these I am also planning on continuing my journey making front-end applications using [Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org/). Currently I'm making a rust-powered game of rock, paper, scissors. Coming from JavaScript, the going is... tough.

## More fun related updates:

### ðŸŽ§ Listening

[La Vita Nuova](https://open.spotify.com/album/3uF0lelesKigBc6H9NGzDq?si=6LTRW9uBSte4H86cY6S_uQ) by [Christine and the Queens](http://www.christineandthequeens.com/). On repeat.

### ðŸ“• Reading

Finally getting around to reading The Book of Dust (Volume One) by Philip Pullman. I've been a big fan of His Dark Materials since they came out and have read the original trilogy many, many times. So no pressure for this one then!

### ðŸŽ® Playing

[Old Man's Journey](http://oldmansjourney.com/). This is proving to be the welcome antithesis of Dark Souls which, quite frankly, I've grown weary of!

## Now pages?

Aye, [now pages](https://nownownow.com/about).
