## High-level

My main focus is trying to shift my skillset from being a full-stack developer who prefers working on the front-end to a _front-end developer_ proper. And I don't mean learning React!

What I am really wanting to hone in on is performant, accessible **design**. In other words, making stuff - starting with this website! It's pretty simple in its current form, but I've got plenty of ideas that I'd love to implement.

## What I'm doing now

Currently learning about the {{<external-link href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Web_Animations_API">}}Web Animations API{{</external-link>}} and how it can be applied to motion design on the web.

In an attempt {{<footnote-link monoculture>}}to diversify{{</footnote-link>}} my front-end skill set, I'm learning {{<external-link href="https://www.rust-lang.org/">}}Rust{{</external-link>}} and {{<external-link href="https://webassembly.org/">}}WebAssembly{{</external-link>}} by, slowly but surely, working my way through the {{<external-link href="https://doc.rust-lang.org/stable/book/title-page.html">}}Rust language book{{</external-link>}} and the {{<external-link href="https://rustwasm.github.io/docs/book/">}}Rust WebAssembly book{{</external-link>}} &mdash; both really great introductions into the language. Hopefully, I'll be able to update this page with Rust-related projects soon!

### ðŸŽ§ Listening

{{<external-link href="https://music.monstercat.com/album/fear-is-fleeting-ep">}}Fear is Fleeting{{</external-link>}} and {{<external-link href="https://music.monstercat.com/album/life-overseas-ep">}}Life Overseas{{</external-link>}} by {{<external-link href="http://puppetmusic.net/">}}Puppet{{</external-link>}} are pretty much on repeat. I find it difficult to explain why I like Puppet's music so much, but it's **awesome**. Also the manga artwork really adds to the music &mdash; art direction ftw!

### ðŸ“• Reading

I'm reading {{<external-link href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Around_the_World_in_Eighty_Days">}}Around the World in Eighty Days{{</external-link>}} for the first time &mdash; mainly because I enjoyed playing the {{<external-link href="https://www.inklestudios.com/80days/">}}80 Days{{</external-link>}} game so much!

### ðŸŽ® Playing

A little late to the party but I'm finally playing {{<external-link href="http://www.celestegame.com/">}}Celeste{{</external-link>}} and it's great.

    I saw a really great lightening talk by {{<external-link href="https://andregarzia.com/">}}Andre Alves Garzia{{</external-link>}} about the monoculture of the web that got me thinking about using WebAssembly. {{<external-link href="https://youtu.be/gjlBcsSNEpU?t=1438">}}Watch it on YouTube{{</external-link>}}.
