## High-level

My main focus is trying to shift my skillset from being a full-stack developer who prefers working on the front-end to a _front-end developer_ proper. And I don't mean learning React!

What I am really wanting to hone in on is performant, accessible **design**. In other words, making stuff - starting with this website! It's pretty simple in its current form, but I've got plenty of ideas that I'd love to implement.

## What I'm doing now

Currently learning about the {{<external-link href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Web_Animations_API">}}Web Animations API{{</external-link>}} and how it can be applied to motion design on the web.

In an attempt {{<footnote-link monoculture>}}to diversify{{</footnote-link>}} my front-end skill set, I'm learning {{<external-link href="https://www.rust-lang.org/">}}Rust{{</external-link>}} and {{<external-link href="https://webassembly.org/">}}WebAssembly{{</external-link>}} by, slowly but surely, working my way through the {{<external-link href="https://doc.rust-lang.org/stable/book/title-page.html">}}Rust language book{{</external-link>}} and the {{<external-link href="https://rustwasm.github.io/docs/book/">}}Rust WebAssembly book{{</external-link>}} &mdash; both really great introductions into the language. Hopefully, I'll be able to update this page with Rust-related projects soon!

## More fun related updates:

I'm listening to {{<external-link href="https://music.monstercat.com/album/fear-is-fleeting-ep">}}Fear is Fleeting{{</external-link>}} and {{<external-link href="https://music.monstercat.com/album/life-overseas-ep">}}Life Overseas{{</external-link>}} by {{<external-link href="http://puppetmusic.net/">}}Puppet{{</external-link>}} pretty much on repeat. I find it difficult to explain why I like Puppet's music so much, but it's awesome.

Just finished reading vols. 1-3 of Naruto. I was given it as a gift well over a year ago and just got round to reading it and am surprised how much I enjoyed it. I really want to read more, or failing that watch the anime!

Playing Super Mario Odyssey. It reminds me of Super Mario Galaxy (my favourite Mario games), mixed in with the best elements of Banjo Kazooie. What's not to love?

    I saw a really great lightening talk by {{<external-link href="https://andregarzia.com/">}}Andre Alves Garzia{{</external-link>}} about the monoculture of the web that got me thinking about using WebAssembly. {{<external-link href="https://youtu.be/gjlBcsSNEpU?t=1438">}}Watch it on YouTube{{</external-link>}}.
