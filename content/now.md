## High-level

My main focus is trying to shift my skillset from being a full-stack developer who prefers working on the front-end to a _front-end developer_ proper&trade;. And I don't mean learning React!

What I am really wanting to hone in on is performant, accessible **design**. In other words, making stuff - starting with this website! It's pretty simple in its current form, but I've got plenty of ideas that I'd love to implement.

## What I'm doing now

**TL;DR** Not loads of development stuff outside of work!

Alongside a large part of the world, I'm currently in lockdown. While for many this has proven a good opportunity to get down to learning some new skills, for me it's more of a case of just getting through the day with two children who can no longer go to school or nursery! When it gets to the end of the day I find that I can't bring myself to look at a laptop.

On the plus side, this means I'm managing to catch-up with various books, games and TV!

Once I get into a rhythm then I'm sure I'll get back into doing more web stuff &mdash; I'm really keen to start re-designing [my white noise app](https://bl-rd.github.io/white-noise-app/) and porting the JavaScript to Rust.

### ðŸ“• Reading

Finally getting around to reading The Book of Dust (Volume One) by Philip Pullman. I've been a big fan of His Dark Materials since they came out and have read the original trilogy many, many times. So no pressure for this one then!

### ðŸŽ® Playing

Currently battling my way through Dark Souls Remastered. Historically this is the type of game I would have avoided like the Undead (hehe), but I'm addicted. Seriously, it's masochistic.
