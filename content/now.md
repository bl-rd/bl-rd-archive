## High-level

My main focus is trying to shift my skillset from being a full-stack developer who prefers working on the front-end to a _front-end developer_ proper&trade;. And I don't mean learning React!

What I am really wanting to hone in on is performant, accessible **design**. In other words, making stuff - starting with this website! It's pretty simple in its current form, but I've got plenty of ideas that I'd love to implement.

## What I'm doing now

Currently learning about the [Web Animations API](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Web_Animations_API) and how it can be applied to motion design on the web.

In an attempt {{<footnote-link monoculture>}}to diversify{{</footnote-link>}} my front-end skill set, I'm learning [Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org/) and [WebAssembly](https://webassembly.org/) by, slowly but surely, working my way through the [Rust language book](https://doc.rust-lang.org/stable/book/title-page.html) and the [Rust WebAssembly book](https://rustwasm.github.io/docs/book/) &mdash; both really great introductions into the language. Hopefully, I'll be able to update this page with Rust-related projects soon!

Also going to try and keep up with the [Codepen Challenges](https://codepen.io/collection/AEWMxz) for some experimentation.

## More fun related updates:

### ðŸŽ§ Listening

[The Shape of Punk to Come](https://refused.bandcamp.com/album/the-shape-of-punk-to-come) by [Refused](https://www.officialrefused.com/). Not sure how I have never listened to this album fully before, but I think it's fast becoming one of my favourite punk albums.

### ðŸ“• Reading

I'm sorry to say that I'm another sucker who has started reading The Witcher. Haven't played any of the games (yet) or seen the Netflix show (also yet) but I'm ~~hopeful I'm going to enjoy~~ really enjoying it.

### ðŸŽ® Playing

Playing through [Aviary Attorney](http://www.aviaryattorney.com/) with my wife, and I am enjoying it **way** more than I thought I would. Mainly because I love good puns/dad-jokes.

## Now pages?

Aye, [now pages](https://nownownow.com/about).

    I saw a really great lightening talk by [Andre Alves Garzia](https://andregarzia.com/) about the monoculture of the web that got me thinking about using WebAssembly. [Watch it on YouTube](https://youtu.be/gjlBcsSNEpU?t=1438).
