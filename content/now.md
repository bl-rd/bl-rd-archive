## High-level

My main focus is trying to shift my skillset from being a full-stack developer who prefers working on the front-end to a _front-end developer_ proper&trade;. And I don't mean learning React!

What I am really wanting to hone in on is performant, accessible **design**. In other words, making stuff - starting with this website! It's pretty simple in its current form, but I've got plenty of ideas that I'd love to implement.

## What I'm doing now

Currently learning about the {{<external-link href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Web_Animations_API">}}Web Animations API{{</external-link>}} and how it can be applied to motion design on the web.

In an attempt {{<footnote-link monoculture>}}to diversify{{</footnote-link>}} my front-end skill set, I'm learning {{<external-link href="https://www.rust-lang.org/">}}Rust{{</external-link>}} and {{<external-link href="https://webassembly.org/">}}WebAssembly{{</external-link>}} by, slowly but surely, working my way through the {{<external-link href="https://doc.rust-lang.org/stable/book/title-page.html">}}Rust language book{{</external-link>}} and the {{<external-link href="https://rustwasm.github.io/docs/book/">}}Rust WebAssembly book{{</external-link>}} &mdash; both really great introductions into the language. Hopefully, I'll be able to update this page with Rust-related projects soon!

### ðŸŽ§ Listening

{{<external-link href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Shape_of_Punk_to_Come">}}The Shape of Punk to Come{{</external-link>}} by {{<external-link href="https://www.officialrefused.com/">}}Refused{{</external-link>}}. Not sure how I have never listened to this album fully before, but I think it's fast becoming one of my favourite punk albums.

### ðŸ“• Reading

I'm sorry to say that I'm another sucker who has started reading The Witcher. Haven't played any of the games (yet) or seen the Netflix show (also yet) but I'm hopeful I'm going to enjoy it.

### ðŸŽ® Playing

A little late to the party but I'm finally playing {{<external-link href="http://www.celestegame.com/">}}Celeste{{</external-link>}} and it's great.
