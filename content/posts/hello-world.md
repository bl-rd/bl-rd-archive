## Why

Initially, it was {{<external-link href="https://www.jvt.me/posts/2019/07/22/why-website/">}}this blog article{{</external-link>}} by Jamie Tanna that resonated with me and got me thinking about creating my own site. As well as being a _good citizen of the web_, I have three main motivations:

- refining/improving my front-end skills;
- the {{<external-link href="https://indieweb.org/">}}indieweb movement{{</external-link>}};
- keeping a track of what I've been up to

Also, personal sites are {{<external-link href="https://personalsit.es/">}}all the rage these days{{</external-link>}}!


## Sharpen the saw

My plan for 2020 is to focus on becoming a **specialist** front-end developer - and there are a lot of new features and APIs being shipped these days. Having a personal site will hopefully push me to try some of these shiny new things. At the time of writing, this site (progressively!) uses {{<external-link href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Web_Components">}}native web components{{</external-link>}} and the {{<external-link href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Web_Animations_API">}}web animations API{{</external-link>}}.

## Indieweb

The {{<external-link href="https://indieweb.org/">}}indieweb{{</external-link>}} sounds pretty cool, and ticks a lot of boxes for me. Even as a reasonably seasoned developer though, I find the sheer amount of concepts in rather overwhelming &mdash; thankfully sites like {{<external-link href="https://indiewebify.me/">}}indewebify.me{{</external-link>}} simplify things a bit. It'll be a continual work in progress, but as with most things on the web, a fun challenge.

## Self-documentation

There is also the additional benefit of having somewhere just to dump _stuff_. For example, I am planning to keep track of my favourite albums as I discover them, and I (very) occasionally like to think I can learn to make art and I like the idea of having a decentralised place where I can store what I make and keep track of what I've done.

There is also the subject of blogging, or just sharing generally. I've read so many times that is a good thing to blog about web dev stuff, but I've always been too introverted to do it. While I don't really agree with the term or the connotations, I can probably be categorised as a {{<external-link href="https://css-tricks.com/dark-matter-what-it-is-and-how-we-all-contribute-to-it/">}}Dark-Matter Developer{{</external-link>}}. I've read plenty of blogs, been to conferences, looked at loads of talented people's work but never felt like I could contribute anything meaningful. Well, going forward I'm taking the approach of &ldquo;{{<external-link href="https://www.sarasoueidan.com/desk/just-write/">}}Just Write{{</external-link>}}&rdquo; and see what happens. At the very least it will serve as a useful reminder for future me, and help me focus my thoughts in a vaguely coherent way!

## Bonus points

The bottom line is that I'm hoping to enjoy it. It will be nice to revisit why I enjoy working in this industry and to experiment and challenge myself on the way. All in my safe little corner of the world wide web.
