intro: I've created a personal website! It has a blog! Ok, now what?

## Why

There are a few reasons as to why I wanted to get my own personal website (apart from them being {{<external-link href="https://personalsit.es/">}}all the rage these days{{</external-link>}}), but it boils down to two:

- refining/improving my front-end skills;
- and the {{<external-link href="https://indieweb.org/">}}indieweb movement{{</external-link>}}.

## Sharpen the saw

I'm very lucky in that I currently have a great job at {{<external-link href="https://www.lancaster.ac.uk">}}Lancaster University{{</external-link>}}, where I get to work in a small team on some interesting projects. We have a great deal of freedom to experiment with new web technologies and browser features without having to worry too much about the bottom line, which is great.

As the workflow and tech stack that we use for our projects has matured (Vue.js front-end, C# WebAPI and SQL Server backend), there is the danger of becoming a bit _comfortable_.

My plan for 2020 is to focus on becoming a **specialist** front-end developer &mdash; and there is _a lot_ of new features and APIs being shipped these days. Having a personal site will hopefully push me to try some of these shiny new things!

## Indieweb

The {{<external-link href="https://indieweb.org/">}}indieweb{{</external-link>}} sounds pretty cool, and ticks a lot of boxes for me. Even as a seasoned developer though, I find the sheer amount of concepts in rather overwhelming &mdash; thankfully sites like {{<external-link href="https://indiewebify.me/">}}indewebify.me{{</external-link>}} simplify things a bit. It'll be a work in progress, but as with most things on the web, a fun challenge.

## Bonus points

There is also the additional benefit of having somewhere just to dump _stuff_. For example, I am planning to keep track of my favourite albums as I discover them, and I very ocassionally like to think I can learn to make art and this would be a good place to keep track of what I've done.

Obviously this is all going to be documented in blog form &mdash; or at least, I'm going to do my best! This will be the biggest challenge for me as I've historically been very reluctant to put things out there (_there_ being the internet) and have shied away from social media generally.

The bottom line is that I'm hoping to enjoy it. It will be nice to revisit why I enjoy working in this industry, and to experiment and challenge myself on the way. All in my safe little corner of the world wide web.

- Keep a track of things
- Experiment
- Fun, remember why I started doing code in the first place
- personal challenge
- share (developer tea episode)
