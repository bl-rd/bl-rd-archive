      <p>
          I currently work at <a href="https://www.lancaster.ac.uk" rel="noreferrer">Lancaster University</a>, one of the <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/education/ng-interactive/2018/may/29/university-league-tables-2019" rel="noreferrer">top 10 universities in the UK</a>.
      </p>
      <p>
          I am a developer in a small team, focusing on providing platforms such as the <a href="https://portal.lancaster.ac.uk/portal/news" rel="noreferrer">Student Portal</a> and <a href="https://portal.lancaster.ac.uk/intranet/news" rel="noreferrer">Staff Intranet</a>, as well as APIs and systems for developers and staff at the University.
      </p>

          Technically, I guess I'm a <i>full-stack</i> developer, using .NET and SQL Server on the back-end, but really I consider my self a front-end developer! My JavaScript framework of choice is currently <a href="https://vuejs.org/" rel="noreferrer">Vue</a>, but where possible I prefer to write well-structured semantic HTML, with plain old CSS and JavaScript. Feel free to have a look at some of <a href="https://github.com/bl-rd" rel="noreferrer">my side projects on GitHub</a><sup><a href="#footnote-1">1</a></sup>.

          My favourite part of my job is making performant, accessible and progressively enhanced websites.

      <h2>Not work</h2>
      <p>
          I’m a dad so I don’t actually have that much free time. When I can make the time, I enjoy climbing and skateboarding (when my knees allow it!).
      </p>
      <p>
          Going full in on <i>better late than never</i>, I’m also tentatively dipping my toes into the world of <a href="/art">making things that don’t involve code</a>.

            If you read the <a href="#not-work">"not work"</a> section, you might understand why <a href="https://github.com/bl-rd" rel="noreferrer">my GitHub account</a> isn't as active as I'd like it to be!
