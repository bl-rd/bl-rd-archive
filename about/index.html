        And I'm also a web developer by trade. I enjoy making performant, accessible and ðŸ‘‰progressively enhanced
        websites, some of which you can find on my <a href="/projects" rel="me">projects page</a>.

        I live <s>in</s> very-near the Lake District in Cumbria, not too far away from where I grew up. Having been away
        to uni, travelled and lived the big(ish) city-life, myself, my wife and our two children now call the good ol'
        Cumbrian countryside ðŸ‘‰<i>yam</i>.

        Currently, I work as a ðŸ‘‰full-stack developer in a small team at <a href="https://www.lancaster.ac.uk"
          rel="noreferrer noopener">Lancaster University</a> (one of <a

        Doing dad-things takes up most of my non-work time. While this is awesome, I try and do other, non-code related,
        things too!

        I'm really into climbing, having had a late-start to the sport a few years ago. Of late, I've also been trying
        to get back into playing guitar after an extended foray in drumming. Occasionally I kid myself into thinking
        that I can still skateboard (I can't), and find myself really relating to <a
          href="https://pkewx3.bandcamp.com/track/mid-20s-skateboarder-4" rel="noreferrer noopener">this song</a> by
        Pkew Pkew Pkew - if only it was called 'Early-thirties skateboarder'...

        You can get a better idea of what I'm up to <em>right now</em> on <a href="/now" rel="me">my /now page</a>.

        I was inspired to put this website together after coming across a handful of awesome personal websites (notably
        <a href="https://www.jvt.me/posts/2019/07/22/why-website/" rel="noreferrer noopener"
          title="Why I Have a Website and You Should Too">this blog article</a> by <a href="https://www.jvt.me/"
