  <p>I'm a human who makes web things</p>

    <p>
      I currently work at <a href="https://www.lancaster.ac.uk" rel="noreferrer">Lancaster University</a>, one of the <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/education/ng-interactive/2018/may/29/university-league-tables-2019" rel="noreferrer">top 10 universities in the UK</a>.
    </p>
    <p>
      I am a developer in a small team, focusing on providing platforms such as the <a href="https://portal.lancaster.ac.uk/portal/news" rel="noreferrer">Student Portal</a> and <a href="https://portal.lancaster.ac.uk/intranet/news" rel="noreferrer">Staff Intranet</a>, as well as APIs and systems for developers and staff at the University.

      <i>Technically</i>, I guess I'm a full-stack developer, using .NET and SQL Server on the back-end, but really I consider
      <a href="#full-stack-footnote" data-footnote aria-describedby="full-stack-footnote">
        myself a front-end developer.
      </a>
    </p>
    <p>
      If I had to commit, my JavaScript framework of choice is currently <a href="https://vuejs.org/" rel="noreferrer">Vue</a>, but where possible I prefer to write well-structured semantic HTML, with plain old CSS and JavaScript. I put a fair few (but not all!) of <a href="/projects" rel="me">my side projects</a> on <a href="https://github.com/bl-rd" rel="noreferrer">GitHub</a>, <a href="#github-footnote" data-footnote aria-describedby="github-footnote">feel free to have a look.</a>
    </p>
    <p>
      My favourite part of my job is making performant, accessible and progressively enhanced websites.

    <h2 data-background="not work">Not work</h2>
    <p>
      Iâ€™m a dad so I donâ€™t actually have that much free time. When I can make the time, I enjoy climbing and skateboarding (knees allowing).
    </p>
    <p>
      Going full in on <i>better late than never</i>, Iâ€™m also tentatively dipping my toes into the world of <a href="/art">making things that donâ€™t involve code</a>.

          Just to be clear, although I am a back-end generalist I put myself fully in the front-end developer camp ðŸ’ª. I do tend to agree with some of the
