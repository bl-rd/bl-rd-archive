        And I'm also a web developer by trade. I enjoy making performant, accessible and ðŸ‘‰progressively enhanced
        websites, some of which you can find on my <a href="/projects" rel="me">projects page</a>.

        I live <s>in</s> very near the Lake District in Cumbria, not too far away from where I grew up. Having been away
        to uni, travelled and lived the big(ish) city-life, myself, my wife and our two children now call the good ol'
        Cumbrian countryside ðŸ‘‰<i>yam</i>.
      </p>
      {# <aside class="extra">
          &ldquo;Yam&rdquo; is the traditional Cumbrian term for &ldquo;home&rdquo;. In fact, one of my favourite sayings is &ldquo;'As gaan yam&rdquo; (I'm going home).

        Currently, I work as a ðŸ‘‰full-stack developer in a small team at <a href="https://www.lancaster.ac.uk"

      <p>
        Doing dad-things takes up most of my non-work time. While this is awesome, I try and do other, non-code related,
        things too!

        I'm really into climbing, having had a late-start to the sport a few years ago. Of late, I've also been trying
        to get back into playing guitar after an extended foray in drumming. Occasionally I kid myself into thinking
        that I can still skateboard (I can't), and find myself really relating to <a
          href="https://pkewx3.bandcamp.com/track/mid-20s-skateboarder-4" rel="noreferrer noopener">this song</a> by
        Pkew Pkew Pkew - if only it was called 'Early-thirties skateboarder'...

        You can get a better idea of what I'm up to <em>right now</em> on <a href="/now" rel="me">my now page</a>.

        I was inspired to put this website together after coming across a handful of awesome personal websites (notably
        <a href="https://www.jvt.me/posts/2019/07/22/why-website/" rel="noreferrer noopener"
          title="Why I Have a Website and You Should Too">this blog article</a> by <a href="https://www.jvt.me/"
          rel="noreferrer noopener">Jamie Tanner</a>) and <a href="https://indieweb.org/" rel="noreferrer noopener">the
          indieweb movement</a>.
      </p>
      <p>
        This inspiration came around the same time I was looking to get back into web <em>design</em>, and felt like it
        would be a good opportunity to do just that.
      </p>
      <p>
        I also wanted to challenge myself as in the past I've always been reluctant (read: terrified) of putting stuff
        on social media. As others have pointed out, a personal site feels like a safe way to put stuff out there. Most
        likely it will just disappear into the void, but if people find it and it read it then, well, that's fine!
