# How do! ðŸ‘‹

> ðŸŽ© **Update 21/10/21**: This is now archived! I'm keeping it for posterity as I quite liked the original design idea, but I'm developing a new site from scratch for the hell of it.

This is the repo for my [website](https://bl-rd.github.io/bl-rd-archive/). It uses [Cobalt](https://cobalt-org.github.io/) as the site generator.
