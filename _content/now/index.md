## What I'm doing now

My main focus is trying to shift my skillset from being a full-stack developer who prefers working on the front-end to a _front-end developer_ proper&#8482;. There are quite a few areas to consider here, and I like to think I have a good grounding in the foundations of the web (HTML, CSS, JavaScript), as well as a lot of experience using popular JavaScript frameworks. However, I really want to hone in on accessibility, performance and semantic markup, as well as good design.

I'm learning [Rust] and [WebAssembly], and how they might be additional tools that can be used for (performant) web interfaces. Currently, I'm working my way through the [Rust language book] and the [Rust WebAssembly book]&mdash;both really great introductions into the language. Hopefully I'll be able to update this page with Rust-related projects soon!

At work I'm working on implementing [web push] notifications on our [Staff Intranet] using our in-house notification system. This is fun, but the actual mechanics of how web push works feels like genuine magic.

## More fun related updates:

- Currently listening to [Romaplasm] by [Baths] a lot. I even bought the CD(!). Added it to my [2019 music log].
- Trying my hardest to finish the first Game of Thrones book, prompted by nostalgia from the final series ending. I'm enjoying it, but it's just sooooo long...
- Having fun playing Bayonetta 2 on the Wii U. This is to make room for the Switch we might possibly definitely be getting at Christmas ðŸ™‚.
