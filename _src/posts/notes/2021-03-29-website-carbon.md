I added [Wholegrain Digital's](https://www.wholegraindigital.com/) [website carbon calculator badge](https://www.websitecarbon.com/) to this site, which estimates that a single page view uses around 0.01g of CO<sup>2</sup> (at time of writing). Apparently, that's cleaner than 97% of all websites. Sounds quite good, but as this site is mainly HTML, CSS and a light dusting of JavaScript I was hoping it would be higher!

I've made certain design decisions to make this website as performant and "lite" as possible, and I'm glad to see it has paid off for the most part. The next thing I'd like to focus on is moving away from Netlify to a green hosting provider.

You can see what the badge looks like [here](#wcb).
