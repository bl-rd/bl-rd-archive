So here it is, my first [note](https://indieweb.org/note) ðŸ¥³

It doesn't do anything other than represent a minimal "post" at this stage, but I'm going to have an experiment to see if it might be a worthwhile development.

In the interests of making this post less dull, [Kaguu](https://kaguu.bandcamp.com/) are **awesome**.
