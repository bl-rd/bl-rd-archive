I'm learning Japanese&mdash;just because&mdash;and I'm using [WaniKani](https://www.wanikani.com) to learn how to _read_ Japanese. 

Unless you're a language&ndash;learning buff, that might sound pretty dull. But the user experience of using WaniKani is something else. So much so that I'm actually **paying** to use the service! The tone of the mnemonics they use, the design of the website &dash; hell, even the emails they send you when you level up are great.

It's really good to see. And the fact that this is a website (and not a native mobile app) that works _beautifully_ on a small device makes me happy. Hats off.
