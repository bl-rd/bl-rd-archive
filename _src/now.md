## S'up

Sure, it's important to keep your professional skills up-to-date, but, hey, life is short! Fun things <abbr title="for the win">FWT</abbr>. I really want to spend some more time learning [Rust](https://www.blender.org/) and how it can be used in front-end web development, but it's taking a back seat to stuff that is better for the soul for the time being.

Here is what I am currently focusing my time on:

- Learning to make things in [Blender](https://www.blender.org/), just for the hell of it
- Getting back in to drawing
- Working towards a full press push-up as prep for getting back in to climbing
- Spending some time catching up on all the books/games/films I've missed over the last few years.
