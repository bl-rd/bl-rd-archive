  How do? My name is Bill and I'm a web developer based in <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cumbria" rel="nofollow noreferrer">Cumbria</a>. This is my website where I experiment and try to keep track of things I'm interested in.

  I'm currently trying to dig myself out of a JavaScript hole. Outside of web stuff, I like climbing, drawing, games, books and music. Feel free to have a gander at what I'm up to <a href="/now" rel="me">right now</a>.
