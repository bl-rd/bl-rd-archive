<h1>{{ title }}</h1>

My name Bill and I&apos;m a human.
</header>

And I'm also a web developer by trade. I enjoy making performant, accessible and <a href="#pew-footnote" data-footnote aria-describedby="footnote-description" aria-labelledby="pew-footnote" id="pew-link">progressively enhanced websites</a>, some of which you can find on my [projects page](/projects).

I live ~~in~~ very near the Lake District in Cumbria, not too far away from where I grew up. Having been away to uni, travelled and lived the big(ish) city-life, myself, my wife and our two children now call the good ol' Cumbrian countryside <a href="#yam-footnote" data-footnote aria-describedby="footnote-description" aria-labelledby="yam-footnote" id="yam-link"><i>yam</i></a>.

## Work

Currently, I work as a full-stack developer in a small team at [Lancaster University](https://www.lancaster.ac.uk) (one of [the tope 10 universities in the UK](https://www.theguardian.com/education/ng-interactive/2018/may/29/university-league-tables-2019) don't you know).

Feel free to take a look at my CV, or if you prefer you can find me on LinkedIn.

## Not work

Doing dad-things takes up most of my non-work time. While this is awesome, I try and do other, non-code related, things too!

I'm really into climbing, having had a late-start to the sport a few years ago. Of late, I've also been trying to get back into playing guitar after an extended foray in drumming. Occasionally I kid myself into thinking that I can still skateboard (I can't), and find myself really relating to [this song](https://pkewx3.bandcamp.com/track/mid-20s-skateboarder-4") by Pkew Pkew Pkew (early&ndash;thirties and min&ndash;twenties are practically the same thing, aren't they?).

You can get a better idea of what I'm up to _right now_ on [my now page](/now).
